# Component Based UI

## Name 5 Javascript UI Frameworks (other than React)

### Ext JS by Sencha: most comprehensive JavaScript framework for building data-intensive, cross-platform web and mobile applications for any modern device. Ext JS includes 140+ pre-integrated and tested high-performance UI component

### Vue: is a free and open-source progressive JavaScript framework created by Evan You. It uses a template syntax (like Angular) and relies on a component-based architecture (like React)

### Ember: is a productive, battle-tested JavaScript framework for building modern web applications. It includes everything you need to build rich UIs that work on any device. This JavaScript framework is free, open-source, and has a strong community behind it.

### Svelte 3 :Though it’s growing up quickly, Svelte 3 is the new kid on the frameworks block. Rich Harris released Svelte in November 2016 as an open-source project Svelte works differently from most frameworks listed so far. In particular: Whereas traditional frameworks like React and Vue do the bulk of their work in the browser, Svelte shifts that work into a compile step that happens when you build your app.

### Angular: is a free, open-source framework by Google that works for both desktop and mobile.


### What’s the difference between a framework and a library?***

>***A library performs specific, well-defined operations. has codes or functions that developers can reuse and repurpose. A developer writes these codes, and other developers reuse the same code to perform a certain task, like preparing a slideshow, instead of writing it from scratch. It saves them significant time and effort.***

### A framework is a skeleton where the application defines the “meat” of the operation by filling out the skeleton. The skeleton still has code to link up the parts but the most important work is done by the application. are application frameworks that allow developers to manipulate code to meet their unique requirements

#### Examples of libraries: Network protocols, compression, image manipulation, string utilities, regular expression evaluation, math. Operations are self-contained. React.js, Chart.js

#### Examples of frameworks: Web application system, Plug-in manager, GUI system. The framework defines the concept but the application defines the fundamental functionality that end-users care about. Bootstrap, Node.js, Mocha, ExpressJS —————————–


Terms|Def
-----|---
Rendering| Rendering is the creation of a visual representation - a picture or a movie - of data, such as a 3D model or a video composition.Many renderings can be made of the same data - from different angles, in different styles, and different levels of quality. For example one program could render a model in a style that looks like a hand-drawn sketch, and another program could render a photorealistic image of the same model.
Templates| In programming, a template is a generic class or other unit of source code that can be used as the basis for unique units of code. In C++, an object-oriented computing language, there are Standard Template Libraries from which programmers can choose individual template classes to modify. The Microsoft Foundation Class Library (MFCL) is an example.
State| The state is an instance of React Component Class can be defined as an object of a set of observable properties that control the behavior of the component. In other words, the State of a component is an object that holds some information that may change over the lifetime of the component.

#### Why JSX?
> ***React embraces the fact that rendering logic is inherently coupled with other UI logic: how events are handled, how the state changes over time, and how the data is prepared for display.***

#### Instead of artificially separating technologies by putting markup and logic in separate files, React separates concerns with loosely coupled units called “components” that contain both. We will come back to components in a further section, but if you’re not yet comfortable putting markup in JS, this talk might convince you otherwise.

#### React doesn’t require using JSX, but most people find it helpful as a visual aid when working with UI inside the JavaScript code. It also allows React to show more useful error and warning messages.
