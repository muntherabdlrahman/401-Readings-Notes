### Use an analogy
> ***We can access previous and next url searched in web browser by pressing back and next button since, they are linked as linked list.***

### Explain a detail in depth
> ***In computer science, a linked list is a linear collection of data elements whose order is not given by their physical placement in memory. Instead, each element points to the next. It is a data structure consisting of a collection of nodes which together represent a sequence.***

### Why do we use structure in linked list?
> ***Structure in linked list is used to store data of the node as well as the pointer to the next nodeâ€™s address. A linked list is a linear collection of similar data where the next node is reached using the previous node in list.***

### What is the use of structure in linked list?
> ***In C programming, we use structures to create a linked list. The structure is a data type inside which we can define variables with different data types (e.g., int , char , pointer , etc.)***

### How structure is used in linked list?
1. Insert node at the beginning.
2. Insert node in the middle
3. Insert node at the end.


### Advantages over singly linked list 
1. A DLL can be traversed in both forward and backward direction.
2. The delete operation in DLL is more efficient if pointer to the node to be deleted is given. 
3. We can quickly insert a new node before a given node. In singly linked list, to delete a node, pointer to the previous node is needed. To get this previous node, sometimes the list is traversed. In DLL, we can get the previous node using previous pointer.



### Terminology
1. linked list contain nodes that point to the next node .
2. singly mean its point to one reference which is the next node .
3. doubly mean its point to two next references and previous .
4. node its the item\links(data) that live in the node .
