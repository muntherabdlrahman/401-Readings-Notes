## Describe “The Cloud” 

### Describe “The Cloud”=> 
> ***term used to describe a global network of servers, each with a unique function. The cloud is not a physical entity, but instead is a vast network of remote servers around the globe which are hooked together and meant to operate as a single ecosystem.***

### What is a container (as it relates to computers and servers)?
> ***a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another.***

### What is auto-scaling?
>***Autoscaling, also spelled auto scaling or auto-scaling, and sometimes also called automatic scaling, is a method used in cloud computing that dynamically adjusts the amount of computational resources in a server farm - typically measured by the number of active servers - automatically based on the load on the farm.***

### What is bandwidth?
> ***measured as the amount of data that can be transferred from one point to another within a network in a specific amount of time. Typically, bandwidth is expressed as a bitrate and measured in bits per second (bps)***

### How do cloud providers compute service costs?
> ***start by calculating costs for network hardware, network infrastructure maintenance, and labor. These expenses are added together and then divided by the number of rack units a business will need for its IaaS cloud***
