# What are the advantages of TDD approach?

1. Better program design and higher code quality. ...
2. Detailed project documentation. ...
3. TDD reduces the time required for project development. ...
4. Code flexibility and easier maintenance. ...
5. With TDD you will get a reliable solution. ...
6. Save project costs in the long run.


# What is Jest beforeEach?
> beforeEach(fn, timeout)

> ***Runs a function before each of the tests in this file runs. If the function returns a promise or is a generator, Jest waits for that promise to resolve before running the test. ... // Jest will wait for this promise to resolve before running tests***


# What is one downside of Test Driven Development?

> ***Probably, the strongest argument against TDD is that the tests need to be maintained because the code has got to. Whenever requirements change, you would like to vary the code and tests. ... So, actually, this disadvantage is that the same as before when writing code that apparently takes an extended time.***


# Whatâ€™s the primary difference between ES6 Classes and Constructor/Prototype Classes?

ES6 class constructors|  ES5 function constructors
---|-------------
This can be said to be a syntax base for constructor functions and instantiate objects using a new operator | This also uses a new operator for object creation but focuses on how the objects are being instantiated.


Trem| Def
---|-------------
functional programming|   Its a process of building software by composing pure functions, avoiding shared state, mutable data, and side-effects. 
object-oriented programming (OOP) | programming paradigm that relies on the concept of classes and objects. 
class |Its defines the variables and methoed common to all object of certain kind.
super| It refers to the parent class. It is used to call the constructor of the parent class and to access the parent's properties and methods.
this| It refers to the object it belongs to,also it can Pass an argument in the constructor call
Test Driven Development (TDD)| Its a style of programming in three activities=> 1. coding, 2. testing , 3. design 
Jest | Its testing Framework with a focus on simplicity,also It allows you to write tests with an approachable.
Continuous Integration (CI)| Its  merging all developers working copies to a shared mainline several times a day.
REST |Its a software architectural style which uses a subset of HTTP. 
Data Model | Its model that organizes elements of data and standardizes how they relate to one another .
